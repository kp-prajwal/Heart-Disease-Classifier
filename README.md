# Prediction of Heart Diseases using Machine Learning  
A machine learning model is capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.  
The procedure is as follows :  

     Problem definition     
     Data     
     Evaluation    
     Features     
     Modelling     
     Experimentation  
## Features 
* age- age in years 
* sex- (1 = male; 0 = female) 
* cp- chest pain type 
* trestbps- resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
* chol- serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
* fbs- (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 
* restecg- resting electrocardiographic results 
* thalach- maximum heart rate achieved 
* exang- exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 
* oldpeak- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
* slope- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
* ca- number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
* thal- 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect 
* target- 1 or 0
